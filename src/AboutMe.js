            Born in 1990 and raised in Gainesville. I love spending time with my
            beautiful girlfriend, exercising and doing outdoor activites like
            going on nature trails or shooting hoops, playing video games, board
            games or card games with my friends.
          </p>

            I graduated high school from P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School
            in 2009. Attended Santa Fe College shortly after. I decided to take
            a few years off and eventually recieved my AA in Computer Science in
            2016. I've been working at Publix Supermarket since 2012, and just
            recieved my certificate in web application development from
            Gainesville Dev Academy. I am ready to use the new skills I've
            learned to join a team and help contribute in anyway I can.
