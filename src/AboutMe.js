          <p>
            Born in 1990 and raised in Gainesville. I love spending time with my beautiful girlfriend, exercising and
            <br />doing outdoor activites like going on nature trails or
            shooting hoops
            <br />playing video games, board games or card games with my friends.
            <br />Graduated high school from P.K. Yonge Developmental Research
            School in 2009. Attended Santa Fe College shortly after.
            <br />I decided to take a few years off and eventually recieved my
            AA in Computer Science in 2016. I've been working at Publix
            Supermarket since 2012,
            <br /> and just recieved my certificate in web application
            development from Gainesville Dev Academy. I am ready to use the new
            skills I've learned
            <br />to join a team and help contribute in anyway I can.
